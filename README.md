OPS445 Lab 1 – Introduction to Python Programming
Welcome to OPS445 Lab 1!
In this lab, you will begin writing Python programs to practice syntax and foundational skills such as:
• 	Outputting text to the screen
• 	Storing data inside variables
• 	Using math operators
• 	Debugging and reading error messages

📚 Lab Objectives
• 	Create your first Python program ()
• 	Work with values and variables:
• 	Strings
• 	Integers
• 	Arithmetic operations
• 	Learn to run Python programs from both the Python3 shell and the bash shell
• 	Practice debugging by reading and interpreting error messages

📂 Lab Files
You will create and work with the following files during this lab:
• Hello World program
• Strings practice
• Integers and arithmetic practice
• Combined exercises
• Output log from the checking script

🧩 Tips
• Compare Python’s  function with Bash’s  command to understand differences.
• Experiment with errors (e.g., missing quotes or parentheses) to strengthen debugging skills.
• Keep your code organized and well-commented for easier review.
